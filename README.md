# Diabetes-Prediction

### About Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic condition brought on by either insufficient insulin production by the pancreas or inefficient insulin utilisation by the body. A hormone called insulin controls blood sugar levels. Uncontrolled diabetes frequently causes hyperglycemia, also known as raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, which over time can seriously harm many different bodily systems, particularly the nerves and blood vessels.

Diabetes can pose issues for pregnant women and their unborn children. Poor diabetes management during pregnancy raises the baby's risk for birth abnormalities and other issues. For the woman, it may also result in major difficulties. Birth abnormalities and other health issues can be prevented with proper prenatal and postpartum treatment.

#### Dataset

#### Variables
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
